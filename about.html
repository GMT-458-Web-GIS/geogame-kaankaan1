        <h1>About the Game</h1>
        <p> Welcome to the Line Length Guessing Game! This game challenges your perception of distances on a map. By showcasing the differences between the Earth's curved geoid and a flat map projection, it highlights how geographical projections can create optical illusions.</p>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>1. Observe the two lines displayed on the map: one red and one blue.</p>
        <p>2. Guess which line is longer by clicking the corresponding button.</p>
        <p>3. Receive feedback and see the actual lengths of both lines. When your incorrect count reaches 3, the game is over and you start over.</p>
        <p>4. Continue playing to improve your intuition about map distortions.</p>
        <h2>Credits</h2>
        <p>This game was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the help of the OpenStreetMap API for map rendering.</p>
